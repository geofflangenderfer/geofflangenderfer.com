Q: Why does NY currently have 10x the number of [confirmed coronavirus cases][0] as the next state? There are two possibilities:
- it's more widespread in NY
- they're testing more. As they administer more tests, they get more confirmed cases. 

Let's look at a graph of confirmed cases vs. administered tests. If these show a strong correlation, increased testing explains the outsized confirmed cases for NY.
