In 2017, I read about AI beating professional poker pros. I felt a stab of fear. My work as a trader was similar. I thought: am I next?

I channeled that fear into teaching myself to code. I moved to Medellin, Colombia and got busy grinding youtube tutorials. This led to paid freelance work through Upwork and a bootcamp TA position at the University of Texas.

I learned that fear is a signal for change. I harnessed it to propel myself forward. And, I learned I'm more powerful than I thought.

Feel free to reach out if you're facing similar fears and not sure what's next.
