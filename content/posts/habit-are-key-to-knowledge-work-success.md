- Knowledge skill compound growth is the key to long-term success. Skills you
  gain today will be more valuable tomorrow because they multiply a larger
  principal (finance definition).
- compound growth results from consistency over time. You cannot remember
  something 1 year from now if you cram it into your head over a week.

## Questions Raised
- what are the most important habits to develop?
- how can we develop more compounding habits?
- How do you recognize lagging habits?
- how can you get others to point out what you can't see? We've all overfit to
  our lived experience. How can we overcome this false certainty?
