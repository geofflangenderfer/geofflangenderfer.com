- Kotlin is still new, so there isn't the body of tutorials available compared to established languages like Java or Python.
- That means going to the source material from the language creators, JetBrains.
- Kotlin Koans are a set of exercises that will quickly get Java developers up to speed.
- They were intimidating to start without prior Java experience. But, I'm happy I pushed through because my Kotlin productictivity has increased.
