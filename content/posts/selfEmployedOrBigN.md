- Freedom over my time is the most important thing to me. I may be discounting
  the costs:
  - less money
  - less recognition
- A self-employed business is successful if and only if they solve customer
  problems. At a large company, you can afford to specialize into very niche
  fields. This removes you from solving customer problems directly. It's hard to
  know your impact in this this situation.

-SWOT Analysis
  - Strengths
    - concentrate longer than most
    - Empathise with others
  - Weaknesses
    - Discount emotions more than others. Making other feel good may deserve more attention.
  - Opportunities
    - Big N job
    - their stock will do very well in the future
    - my strengths don't lend to success in corporate environment. I discount the value of work theatre.
  - Threats
    - Age bias/poor health as I get older
    - Dating market competition is getting more money/recognition
    - I'm an easy scapegoat because of low agreeableness
