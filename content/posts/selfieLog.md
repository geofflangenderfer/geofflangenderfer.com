# New app idea

## Problem
switching contexts between workout focus and data collection breaks flow

## Solution
separate these two concerns. Track physical progress through post-workout mirror selfies. Restore physical movement as sole-focus during workouts.


## Benefits
- avoids interrupting workout with data collection
- at least equal to other logs in progress tracking over time
  - tracks physical progress through photo evidence
- reminds you not to break your selfie streak
- gives shareable physical progress slidereel after 30 days

## User experience
- day 1:
  - finish workout
  - take mirror selfie
...
- day 10:
  - get notification of 10 day streak. Urge user not to break it

...
- day 30:
  - take last selfie
  - get a slide-reel from day 1-30 showing progress
  - congratulate user for making it 
  - highlight differences in day 1/30 photos

## Experiment: 30 day work from home fitness challenge
### Goal
dis/prove that breaking workout flow with data logging is annoying enough that people would pay for a solution
### Steps
- build basic prototype 
- use for 30 days
- document with youtube
- promote signup page to collect emails
