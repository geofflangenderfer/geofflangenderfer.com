# Hot Take
This is an evolving article. Currently, a hot take. I'll be researching and
updating over time

## Summary
I recommend it because it gives you job-loss insurance

## Drawbacks
- Learning Curve: now need to learn marketing and sales on top of development
- lower pay without work history
- often clients don't reach for a freelancer until deadlines are tight. This
  means you will be under time crunch.

## Benefits
- insurance against job-loss
- Practice skills needed to start a business (marketing, sales)
- freedom over: hours, pay rate, location
- remote work is a rising wave. Get started now to ride it
  - CDC restrictions will push companies to give up offices

  - More jobs are becoming software jobs. There is little friction going remote
    for them.
