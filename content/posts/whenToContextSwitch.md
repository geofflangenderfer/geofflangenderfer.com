## Motivation
I'm on Leetcode, a technical software interview practice site. I've submitted my fifth attempt at an algorithm problem. It's incorrect. My stress levels rise. Why can't I figure this out? Am I dumb? 

Knowledge work can be stressful. This is uncomfortable short-term, but beneficial long-term. The human capital compounds over time. So, it's important to learn to deal with this side effect.

## Questions Raised
This short-term stress, long-term benefit raises some questions: 
- should you persevere or switch contexts to something less stressful? 
- how do you switch contexts?
- how do you know what works?

## Persevere or Switch
To persevere or context switch is a tough question. If you switch too fast, you will not improve frustration resilience. If you switch too late, you waste time without any tangible benefit.

Here are some signs I've reached my frustration limit:
- I seek a quick hit of dopamine: twitter or youtube usually
- I eat, especially high-sugar food

Your signals may be different, but you will learn to recognize them. Try a stress-reduction strategy after recognizing rising frustration levels.

## Context Switching Strategies
When I recognize frustration, I attempt one of the following:
- go for a walk
- take a nap
- switch to an unrelated subject

A walk reduces stress the most and switching to an unrelated subject the least.

## Measuring Strategy effectiveness
Often you'll receive a serendipitous thought while in your new context. I don't know how to explain it except that it's happened many times. I've also tried persevering while blocked for extreme amounts of time. This has never led to a serendipitous thought. It has left me more defeated though.

Track strategy effectiveness, for example in a journal. For me, I roughly track the time between becoming blocked/unblocked. If one strategy takes longer, it's less effective than a shorter-acting one. You will know an effective strategy if it reduces pleasure-seeking behavior.


## Conclusion
Knowing when to switch contexts is hard. You will learn the line between perseverance and switching through experimentation. With time, you will find effective strategies. 

Compare different treatments by comparing pleasure-seeking behavior and time to unblocking. Short-term, switch contexts sooner than later because perseverance levels are fixed. Long-term, push yourself a bit outside your comfort levels. This will improve your perseverance capacity.
