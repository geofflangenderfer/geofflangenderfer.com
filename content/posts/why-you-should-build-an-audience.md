# Intro
Coronavirus times feel like a science fiction movie:
- 1/3 of US workforce [worked freelance][0]
- A video communications stock is up 133% [this year][1]
- US unemployment has gone from [3.6% to 8.4%][2] since January

Uncertainty is high. Jobs are in short supply. Everyone is stuck at home. Yet, the conditions for going independent have never been better.

It's not the right choice for everyone. But everyone should consider it.

### Shoot for Ikigai
Ikigai is the Japanese word for "a reason for being". It's the intersection of:
- what you love
- high market value
- what the world needs
- your skills (present + future)

If you feel ikigai on your death bed, you've lived a fulfilling life.

### Low Barriers to Entry
The online tools to sustainably reach your audience have never been better:
- Social media for access to new fans
- Wordpress for publishing on your own property
- Stripe and Patreon for collecting payments 
- Teachable for course building 
- Youtube and Udemy for skill building


The effect is eliminating middlemen that make building an audience of 100 or 1,000 true fans a real possibility. 

In [1,000 True Fans][3], Kevin Kelly defines a true fan as someone who buys everything you produce. With 1,000 true fans paying you $100/year, you can make a six figure income. For less than $9/month, your true fans can help you turn your shared passion into a career.

This long-tail of micro content-creators is made possible by large tech giants that have driven down the cost of sharing content. Cloud services like AWS and Google Cloud power Twitter and Youtube. 

### A Wealth Ladder Stepping Stone
![Wealth Ladders][wealth-ladders]

An audience is an accelerator as you climb [wealth ladders][4]. The idea is that you start on the first ladder as an employee. You gain skills and savings on each ladder to propel yourself to the next. The highest ladder is software-as-a-service (SAAS). True passive income and leverage.

When you build an audience, you're building relationships that lead to sustainability. Your readers enjoy your content. Maybe because you teach them a valuable skill. Maybe for entertainment. The more they read the more they like you. They will support you when you monetize because that's what friends do. A beautiful voluntary exchange. 

### Less Risky Compared to SAAS
SAAS is risky because you build a product based on assumptions about your audience. You can de-risk this with a [lean startup][5] approach. But, starting with an audience is an unfair advantage. You deeply understand your audience so you can be more certain about whether an info or software product will resonate. Do you think Sam Harris doubted whether his [app][6] would be a success?


### Conclusion
The barriers to building an audience have never been lower. Amidst surreal circumstances, there is hope. Build an audience. You can build a sustainable career catering to that audience in a variety of ways. And, you de-risk your approach to a successful SAAS product.
