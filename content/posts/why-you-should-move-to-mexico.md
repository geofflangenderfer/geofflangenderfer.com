# Intro
I left Austin, TX for Mexico and I don't have plans to move back. And, you should, too. Mexico is beautiful, cheap, and a great "internet university" campus.

## Internet University Campus
The internet gives every person a shot at 7 billion people. The world population. You can sell an ebook or an app as easily to someon in China as in the US. 

The lower Mexican COL gives you room to experiment. With ecommerce, digital marketing, coding, design, or copywriting. The limit is your imagination. 

You can make small bets like $200 on a facebook ads course and be ok if it doesn't work.

## Work From Home (WFH)
Many companies are allowing employees to work from home. This means you can move. Zoom works fine in Mexico. 

Wayne Gretsky, a great hockey player, once said, "I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been." This work from home trend is set to continue. If you work in tech and your company has not OK'ed WFH yet, they will. And, more companies are becoming software companies. This will add to the trend. Start gaining remote experience. It will appreciate in value.

## Dating Market Value
I've used Tinder in Colombia, Mexico, and Austin, TX. It's a small sample, but I got the least likes with the same pics in Austin, TX. One explanation might be that people like novelty or something exotic. The result is better results in online dating. 

## Bad Environment Escape Hatch
Bad environments are not conducive to ambition. Those around you won't like to see you change because it reminds them of their own failures. You can build a whole new life in Mexico. You can create a better environment for self-improvement. 

## Lower Cost of Living (COL)
Everything and everywhere is expensive in the US. With the talk of printing trillion dollar coins, inflation is a real risk that could make things worse. For the same level of spending, you get much more outside of the US. To convince yourself, take a look at Mexican Airbnb prices and compare it to your current rent/mortgage. 

## Weather
The Pacific and Caribbean Mexican coasts have some of the most beautiful beaches and weather in the world. You can't help but be happy in the sun. See <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651" target="_blank">SAD</a>.

## Confidence Building
Moving to a new country without speaking the language is tough. But, can you imagine how proud of yourself you will be once you've integrated yourself? The pride won will carry-over to other challenges and it will make you a better person.

## Adventure
You will experience a new language, people, and culture. This is exhilirating. Everything will be so foreign, it will feel you're an alien in a new world. You can't help but feel grateful after experiencing such wonder. 

## Meet Like Minded Travellers
It takes high agency, openness, and conscientiousness to successfully navigate a new country. These are the type of people you want to surround yourself with. Their positive energy will rub off on you. 
  
## Why You Should Not Move
A few reasons why you should not move to Mexico:
- you're happy with your career prospects in US. If you're a software engineer at Google, many of the advantages don't apply.
- you drink excessively. The key to avoiding trouble in Mexico/SA is avoiding being out drunk after midnight. It's much harder to get out of trouble in a foreign country, without friends, and not knowing the language. 
- you can't handle loneliness. There is an adjustment period where you haven't met fellow travellers and you don't know spanish and it's lonely. Don't come if this is too uncomfortable.

## Conclusion 
Mexico is a beautiful country that is a great "internet university" campus. It's low COL allows you to learn how to take advantage of internet leverage. Minus a few circumstances, you should consider moving to Mexico
